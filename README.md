# 1.	Business Goals for the Pricing Analysis
Optimize Car Retail Pricing Strategy

Goal: Identify the optimal price range for different car models and conditions and help sellers price their vehicles competitively to increase sells volumes/revenues while maximizing profitability.

Analysis: Use SQL and Python to analyze car transaction data


# 2.	Technical highlights

(1)	Price vs. Odometer Correlation:
Calculate the average price by odometer ranges to see how price drops with mileage.

These three factors—odometer reading, condition, and model year—are the primary drivers influencing car prices. In a competitive pricing strategy, sellers can focus on setting prices relative to these key factors to attract buyers while maximizing profitability.

# 3.	Summary

A brief summary of the outcomes based on the data:

1. Average Price by Odometer Range:
(1) Cars with 0-50K miles have the highest average prices.
(2) Low-mileage cars can be priced at a premium, as buyers are willing to pay more for less wear.

3. Average Price by Condition:
(1) Cars in better conditions (like "like new" or "excellent") command higher prices.
(2) Vehicles in "salvage" or "fair" condition show significantly lower prices, indicate that condition is a key factor in determining price and value.
(3) Sellers can increase profitability by investing in repairs and maintenance to upgrade vehicle condition.
(4) For cars in poor condition, sellers should adopt a discount strategy or focus on niche buyers (e.g., those interested in salvage or project vehicles).

4. Price Trends by Model Year:
(1) Newer model years generally have higher prices, it shows with a clear decline as model years get older.
(2) Sellers should highlight the features and reliability of newer models to justify higher prices. For older cars, sellers can emphasize good maintenance history to sustain competitive pricing.
